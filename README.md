# Tier-Price-Group-Magento-2
This is a magento 2 custom module that enhances magento 2 default tier prices functionality to assign tier pricess to products  without creating the price break points multiple times.

Once the price brak points has been created , admin can just assign that group id to product and module will create all price group break pints for that product.
